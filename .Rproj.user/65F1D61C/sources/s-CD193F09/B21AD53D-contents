This website is for Duncan Hill's Math230 Final Project.

  I am a 2024 chemical engineering student at Bucknell University who is on the Men's Lacrosse team.

  I plan to graduate with a BS in Chemical Engineering, with a concentration in Material Science Engineering. I also plan to have a minor in Mathematics (Statistics).

  This website was created for the MATH230 Final Project using RStudio and Distill. This site displays visualizations I created during the duration of the course as well as an analysis of the 2017 and 2018 NFL season.
