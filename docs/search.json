      "contents": "\r\nThrough the duration of this year, many different visualizations were\r\ngenerated in RStudio for MATH230. The name of the course is “Data\r\nVisualization and Computing” so it makes sense after all! These five\r\npieces best represent the work I have done this semester.\r\nPiece #1: Bucknell\r\nMandelbrot (Generative)\r\n The detail in the spirals as\r\nwell as the distinct orange and blue contrast is what made me enjoy this\r\npiece of generative art. I created this mandelbrot using the arTsy\r\nmandelbrot function. I submitted this Mandelbrot set to the Bucknell\r\nMath Department Postcard competition.\r\nPiece 2: Underwater\r\n(Generative)\r\nUnderwater by Duncan HillThis is another piece of generative artwork I created using the arTsy\r\npackage. It reminded me of deep water, and it was created using the\r\nnebula package.\r\nPiece 3: A Titanic Mosaic\r\n(Plot)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis plot is called “A Titanic Mosaic”. It was created using the\r\nggplot2 package ggmosaic. The dataset is built in to RStudio, and it\r\ndetails the class, gender, and survival of each passenger on the Titanic\r\non the night it sank.\r\nThe graphic is showing the differences that led to different survival\r\nrates among the passengers/crew. Women survived at a higher rate then\r\nmen, and upper class passengers survived at a higher rate than lower\r\nclass passengers. This plot allows for understanding the circumstances\r\nthat led to survival during the night of this tragedy.\r\nPiece 4: Changing Confidence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth visualization I have displayed here is meant to\r\ndemonstrate the relationship between confidence level and the confidence\r\ninterval width.\r\nThe population was randomly generated using a normal distribution\r\nwith a mean of 48 and a standard deviation of 4. Then, a random sample\r\nof size 40 was taken from this population. Utilizing the data from that\r\nrandom sample, the sample mean and confidence interval were generated\r\nfrom a confidence level of 50% to a confidence level of 99.9%. This\r\nvisualization shows how, as confidence level increases, the interval\r\nwidth also increases.\r\nThis plot was eventually made to be an interactive app using Shiny.\r\nThis app can be found on the link below. It allows for changes in sample\r\nsize, sample mean, and confidence level to see how much those components\r\naffect the width and accuracy of a confidence interval for a given\r\nsample.\r\nShiny App Link:\r\nhttps://rconnect.bucknell.edu/content/4bc055a7-8c0e-4988-83e7-a657ace9fb16\r\nPiece 5: Variations of\r\nFaculty Salary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis visualization uses a data set from the Lock5 Package, from the\r\nCollegeScores dataset. It contains information like admittance rate,\r\nteacher salary, location, and more about each college or University in\r\nthe United States. The main comparison in this graphic is supposed to\r\nshow the differences in professor/faculty salary between Universities in\r\ndifferent locations. Schools that are rural or town based are funded\r\nmuch less than schools that are located in a city or suburb. This makes\r\nsense due to higher costs of living. I chose this graphic because it is\r\nvisually unique and tells a distinct story about how faculty members are\r\npaid differently despite having similar occupations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat defines an\r\ninteresting game, team, or season?\r\nThere are many aspects of football that make NFL games, teams or\r\nseasons so memorable. The historical story lines are what make the NFL\r\nso popular as a sport across the United States. When a specific player\r\nor team plays extraordinarily well, they are continually in the national\r\nspotlight and make the NFL and their franchise a lot of money.\r\nThe most interesting teams often have the best players who score the\r\nmost amount of points. Players like Josh Allen, Patrick Mahomes and\r\nJustin Herbert are revolutionizing the NFL and making games more\r\nexciting to watch. As more interesting football occurs, more money for\r\nthe NFL is generated, as more people tune in to the game to watch what\r\nhappens.\r\nLet’s take a look at a few notable teams from the 2017 season to see\r\nwhat on the field aspects made them interesting (or boring) to\r\nwatch.\r\nTeam Points For\r\nFigure #1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis graph is ordered by total scoring offense by week. The highest\r\nscoring team is on top, followed by the second highest scoring team and\r\nso on. Using this graphic we can see the changes in relative total\r\nscoring ranking of these 6 teams as the year progressed.\r\nEach team has a reason for being represented, as they have something\r\nabout them that makes them unique this season.\r\nThe Eagles made (and won) the Super Bowl\r\nThe Patriots made (and lost) the Super Bowl\r\nThe Rams had an exciting breakout year and lost in the playoffs\r\nThe Bills broke their 20 year playoff drought and lost in the\r\nplayoffs\r\nThe Chargers are my favorite team and missed the playoffs. They\r\nserve as a representation of a relatively normal team.\r\nThe Browns were historically bad and went 0-16.\r\nWeek 14 is also marked with a vertical line. That is the week that\r\nthe Eagles QB and MVP favorite Carson Wentz tore his ACL.\r\nFrom this graphic, we can see a few different things.\r\nWhen their stud QB Carson Wentz went down in Week 14, the Eagles\r\ndecreased in point scored ranking, indicating that their star player had\r\na role in why they were scoring so much.\r\nThe Super Bowl teams (Eagles and Patriots) were both consistently\r\nhigh scoring.\r\nThe Browns were consistently lowest scoring, which makes sense\r\nbecause they did not win a game.\r\nFrom this visualization, we can vaguely understand that high scoring\r\nteams are more likely get into the playoffs and Super Bowl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCombined Points Total\r\nFigure #2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis visualization shows the same type of graphic with the same 6\r\nteams but this time it is ranked by total combined points (both for and\r\nagainst the team).\r\nOnce again, the Eagles, Patriots and Rams are at the top. This time\r\nthe “normal” team, the Chargers, is at the bottom.\r\nFrom this it can be seen that the most interesting teams not only\r\nhave the most points scored, they also have a fair amount of points\r\nscored against them. Because of this we can say that NFL games can be\r\nexpected to be more interesting if more points are going to be\r\nscored.\r\nComparing the 2017 and\r\n2018 NFL Seasons\r\nBetween the 2017 and 2018 NFL seasons, sports gambling was legalized.\r\nHowever, it was still in an infancy stage and did not directly fund the\r\nNFL until 2021. However, gambling terms allow for a different\r\nperspective of an NFL game.\r\nWhy\r\ngambling phrases are important to understanding the NFL\r\nIn the NFL, there is a phrase, “Any Given Sunday”. Every week in the\r\nNFL, there are massive fluctuations in team performance due to a variety\r\nof factors. Because of this it is harder to quantify from the end score\r\nwhat the game “should” have looked like. That is where gambling comes in\r\nhandy for statistics. The gambling industry has access to incredibly\r\npowerful algorithms to calculate betting lines for games. These lines\r\nare the best for understanding what a specific NFL game was supposed to\r\nlook like. Using these expected values, we can investigate the games\r\nthat were supposed to be the most interesting and those that fell\r\nshort.\r\nSpread: The spread refers to the expected score difference\r\nbetween teams. If a team is “favored by 3.5”, the spread is -3.5. This\r\nmeans that the favored team is expected to win by an average of 3.5\r\npoints. The + or - associated with the spread is related to the amount\r\nof money received by the bettor if they win, so for the purpose of this\r\nanalysis all spreads will be positive.\r\nOver/Under: The Over/Under (or O/U) is the expected total amount\r\nof points that will be scored in the game. If the O/U is 44.5, there is\r\nan expectation that, on average, the game will have 44.5 points scored.\r\nIt is called the Over/Under because you either bet that the game will be\r\nover or under that amount in total points. With these terms, we can\r\ninvestigate the differences between the 2017 and 2018 seasons.\r\nDifferences in the\r\n2017 and 2018 seasons\r\nFigure #3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure #4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to these graphs, there is not one factor that\r\noverwhelmingly impacts the performance of a game.\r\nThe most consistent relationship between these two seasons is how\r\nTemperature and the Week are related. The NFL regular season starts in\r\nAugust and goes through January, so the temperature is decreasing by the\r\nweek due to the weather. This decrease does not appear to affect\r\ngames.\r\nIn 2017, there appeared to be a weak positive correlation between\r\nTemperature and the Over/Under. This would indicate that colder games\r\nare expected to be lower scoring. This apparent relationship disappeared\r\nin 2018.\r\nIn 2018, Over/Under had a more direct relationship between the\r\nhome and away scores. Games with a higher O/U are expected to generally\r\nhave higher scores. It is arguable that a lack of correlation between\r\nOver/Under and game scores is more notable.\r\nFrom this graphic, environmental causes such as wind speed and\r\ntemperature did not drastically affect the outcomes of the games. During\r\nthese seasons, the NFL was not affected by an external factor that\r\nimpacted the games. However, there was a change in the form of high\r\nquality, high scoring games.\r\nFinding\r\nInteresting Games through the Over/Under\r\nFigure #5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis plot is the most important to the story of the NFL between these\r\ntwo seasons. It distinctly shows a drastic shift that occurred between\r\nthe 2017 and 2018 seasons.\r\nThis visualization shows the Over/Under (expected score total)\r\ncompared to the actual score total of every regular season game in 2017\r\nand 2018. The line that runs across the middle is y=x. Any data that is\r\nabove the line had more points than the Over/Under, and therefore it was\r\na higher scoring game than expected.\r\nBy focusing on only the games with the highest Over/Under, we can see\r\na distinct difference between 2017 and 2018. In 2017, there were 3 games\r\nthat had a Over/Under that was greater than 55. In 2018, there were 12\r\nsuch games. Among those games, 2017 only had 1 game that went over the\r\nexpected combined total, and it barely made it. In 2018, there were 6\r\ngames that were over, and there were 3 that were barely under. This\r\nindicates that the most hyped regular season games of the year in 2018\r\nnot only were high scoring, but they were consistently high scoring in\r\ncomparison to 2017.\r\nMost notably in 2018, the game that is considered “The Greatest\r\nRegular Season Game” occurred between the Rams and the Chiefs. With an\r\nabsurd Over/Under of 63.5, this game was expected to be high scoring. It\r\ndelivered with a 54-51 scoreline that had 105 total points. If scoring\r\nis what leads the NFL to success, this game was arguably the most\r\nimportant regular season game ever for the NFL.\r\nThis game marked the start of a new era for NFL football.\r\nNFL-wide Point totals\r\nFigure #6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe changes in scoring in the NFL regular season between 2017 and\r\n2018 are quite clear in this bar chart. While the raw difference between\r\nthe scores is not eyepopping, 2018 does have increased scoring. The\r\ngames were expected to score higher, and even then they slightly\r\noutperformed the expected point total.\r\nConclusion\r\nWhile the legalization of gambling did not directly impact the NFL in\r\na distinct way, there was a shift in the NFL between the 2017 and 2018\r\nseasons. If points are what make games more exciting and more\r\nprofitable, then the 2018 season was simply better. There was an\r\nincrease in points that were expected to be scored, and there was an\r\nincrease in points actually scored. This increase of excitement around\r\nthe sport was helpful in allowing the NFL to continue to grow in\r\ninfluence and earn them money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
